# Crop Classification Tutorial

This repository helps you gained a basic understanding of building ML model for classifying crop type from Sentinel-2 satellite images. The tutorial is in the `crop_classification_using_deep_learning` notebook.

## Running the notebook ##
If you want to execute code in the notebook, there are a few steps that need to be done first.
1. Install Dependencies : All dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install use the following command:
   <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>
2. Unzip data
   1. Image data : Decompress all zip files inside `data/image` folder. The unzipped folders will be similar to those in the notebook. No need for rename.
   2. Vector data : Decompress all zip files inside `data/shape` folder. The unzipped folders will be similar to those in the notebook. No need for rename.
